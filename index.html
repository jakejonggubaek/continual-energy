                                Building solutions should not be a mystery to owners, contractors, engineers and operators. We believe that all
                                stakeholders should be able to understand 'how it works' and access the technology. This is one of the reasons that we
                                provide in depth owner training for all projects.

                                of the reasons that Continual provides in depth detailed analyses that look beyond initial project phases, provides
                                continuous support and commissioning and supports projects for the life of the products and provides 24/7 support
